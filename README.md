# Crypto2Billomat

Crypto2Billomat allows your customers to pay Billomat Invoices via crypto currency services like CryptoPanel.de
Due to security related concerns, we decided to split Crypto2Billomat into an Client Server application.
The server application is hosted in an secured limited access environment while the client application is running on an shared webhosting environment.
This concept secures the related access keys off Billomat and CryptoPanel in a more secure manner.

To setup Crypto2Billomat you have to configure and host the client and server application.
See client/config/config.php.dist and server/config/config.php.dist for all related details.
